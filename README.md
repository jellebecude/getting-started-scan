# 1. CTFd local deployment

CTFd is the Capture The Flag platform used by the Joint Cyber Range and in our case is running within Kubernetes. The original project's repository can be found [here](https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd), while [this](https://gitlab.com/hu-hc/jcr/platform/ctf-platform) is the location of the JCR's forked repository.

- **Purpose:** getting started with using the Joint Cyber Range platform and create a backup to restore.

- **Preliminaries:** a Kubernetes environment for deployment, **Docker Desktop** is the easiest one to get started with.

- **Note:** Most tools used are supported on Windows, MacOS and Linux, although this documentation continues using Docker Desktop on Windows, with  WSL2 as backend. Because of WSL and running Bash on Windows, the experience should be close on MacOS and Linux. The WSL distribution for Ubuntu 20.04 will be our Linux user environment and can be downloaded from the Microsoft Store.

**Contributing:** Do you find something that's wrong, got bad spelling, can be better explained, make more efficient use of words, could be extended or you just have general improvements? Please contribute to this guide and other Joint Cyber Range documentation. You can make a [new issue](https://gitlab.com/hu-hc/jcr/getting-started/-/issues/new?issue%5Bmilestone_id%5D=) on the GitLab repo.

You could also take matters in your own hands by creating a [new branch](https://gitlab.com/hu-hc/jcr/getting-started/-/branches/new), making your changes, doing a commit and perform a `Pull request` or in GitLab's terms, creating a new [Merge request](https://gitlab.com/hu-hc/jcr/getting-started/-/merge_requests/new). Your changes will be reviewed by a Joint Cyber Range associated developer.

## 1.2. GitLab and Visual Studio Code

The Joint Cyber Range utilizes the GitLab free tier for its code archive and CI pipeline. Whereas, VS Code is our IDE of choice. It is open source and offers a big catalogue of extensions. Git source control is natively integrated, for you to manage version control straight from within the IDE. Download and install it for [your system](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Next you need to setup access to the code repository in GitLab.

### 1.2.1. Gitlab code repository access

You need a personal access token, to authenticate with the code repository using the HTTPS clone mechanism. For the personal access token, in case of GitLab, go to your account and click **Edit Profile**, then go to **Access Tokens**. Here you can type in your token name, an optional expiration date and select scopes. The scopes that need to be selected are **read_repository** and **write_repository**, if these are selected click **Create personal access token**. Save your new access token now, because you won't be able to access it again.

### 1.2.2. Visual Studio Code

Open a new (empty) VS Code Window and go to the Explorer (Ctrl+Shift+E). Click on Clone Respository and enter the repositoryâ€™s URL: <https://gitlab.com/hu-hc/jcr/jcr-getting-started>. Login in to GitLab by using your personal access token. When the files are loaded, respond to the notice in the right corner and open the cloned repository.

## 1.3. Install and setup Docker Desktop

Download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for Windows or MacOS.

**Windows**: Docker Dekstop requires a WSL (recommended) backend, or Hyper-V on older Windows versions. You also need to have hardware virtualization enabled in your BIOS settings. Full instructions can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install). When installing Docker desktop, make sure on the configuration page **Install required Windows components for WSL 2** or the **Enable Hyper-V Windows Features** option is selected.

After Docker Desktop and WSL have been installed, choose a Linux distribution for WSL from the Windows Store (Ubuntu 20.04 is recommended). It's important to set the distribution to use WSL version 2, please follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/basic-commands#list-install-linux-distributions) for this. Now you can enable its integration with Docker Desktop, as described [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/). This allows for running Docker commands within a WSL Terminal.

**MacOS**: On MacOS, there seems to be no additional requirements.

**Linux**: Docker desktop is not supported on Linux. Use the Docker Engine instead with another local Kubernetes distribution, e.g. K3D, KIND or MiniKube.

Next, enable Kubernetes. Start Docker Desktop, go to **Settings** > **Kubernetes** and make sure **Enable Kubernetes** is checked. 

### 1.3.1. Resetting Docker Desktop and Kubernetes

You can reset the Kubernetes cluster and delete all created resources by going to **Settings** > **Kubernetes**, then click `Reset Kubernetes Cluster`. All reset functions are also conveniently listed when you click on the `Bug` icon, including `Clean / Purge data` and `Reset to factory defaults`. When you do this because you've ran into a problem and are unable to fix it, sometimes it's required to completely re-install Docker desktop.

## 1.4. Install kubectl

Kubectl is the CLI tool to interact with Kubernetes clusters. The following [link](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/) shows installation instructions for Linux, since we're working within our WSL terminal. Windows and MacOS instructions can be found in the menubar. Make sure your current directory is your home directory when installing, e.g. `cd ~/`.

Make sure your kube-config file is in the right location, and includes the correct cluster. On Windows it can be found in: `%USERPROFILE%\.kube\config` or (Mac/Linux `~/.kube/config`) .
For alternative locations you can make it known to kubectl with: e.g. `export KUBECONFIG=PathTo/kube.config` (Linux/MacOS version).

Test with: `kubectl get nodes`, you'll see your Kubernetes cluster nodes and name show up.

## 1.5. Ingress NGINX controller

The CTFd deployment on Kubernetes will make use of an ingress controller. That's a Kubernetes similar to reverse proxy and load balancing functionality. Install the Ingress Nginx controller for Docker Desktop.

```Bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.0.0/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
```

Verify the installation.

```Bash
kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx \
  -l app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx
```

Expected output:
```Bash
NAME                                       READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
ingress-nginx-admission-create-b42k6       0/1     Completed   0          46s
ingress-nginx-admission-patch-6zpd5        0/1     Completed   1          46s
ingress-nginx-controller-fd7bb8d66-qltbg   0/1     Running     0          46s
ingress-nginx-controller-fd7bb8d66-qltbg   1/1     Running     0          50s
```

**Tip:** you can continuously watch the resource by adding the `--watch` paramater. 

## 1.6. TLS certificate creation for HTTPS

Create the required resources for a HTTPS connection, first create the initial TLS certificate.

```
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -nodes -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt -subj "/CN=kubernetes.docker.internal" -days 365
```

Create a Kubernetes namespace for all the CTFd resources.

```Bash
kubectl create namespace ctf-platform
```

Use the created certificate to create a Kubernetes secret with.

```
kubectl create --save-config=true secret tls kubernetes-docker-internal-tls --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key -n ctf-platform --dry-run='client' -o yaml  > k8s/tls-cert-secret.yaml
```

See the created secret.

```
kubectl get secret kubernetes-docker-internal-tls -n ctf-platform
```

<!--
## 1.6. Cert-manager

Cert-manager is used to automatically renew certificates, that will be used to make HTTPS possible. A self-signed certificate is sufficient in your local setup. This is already provided in the form of a Kubernetes secret. You'll only have to install cert-manager as preparation.

```Bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.5.3/cert-manager.yaml
```

Verify the installation.

```Bash
kubectl get pods -n cert-manager
```

Expected output.

```Bash
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cert-manager-848f547974-n8xvv             1/1     Running   0          8s
cert-manager-cainjector-54f4cc6b5-kfbfg   1/1     Running   0          8s
cert-manager-webhook-7c9588c76-kr89r      0/1     Running   0          8s
cert-manager-webhook-7c9588c76-kr89r      1/1     Running   0          10s
```

**Tip:** you can continuously watch the resource by adding the `--watch` paramater. 

**Manual (optional) certificate creation steps:**
A certificate is already provided in the repository, but you can create one yourself, for example when the provided certificate is expired.

Create the initial self-signed CA (Certificate Authority) certificate.

```Bash
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048
```

Create a certificate for the relevant DNS name with the newly created CA key.

```Bash
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca.key -sha256 -subj "/CN=kubernetes.docker.internal" -days 1024 -out ca.crt
```

Create a Kubernetes namespace for the resources to be created.

```Bash
kubectl create namespace ctf-platform
```

Use the self-signed certificate to create a Kubernetes secret. Make sure to change your working directory to the main repository's directory.

```Bash
kubectl create --save-config=true secret tls ca-key-pair --key=ca.key  --cert=ca.crt -n ctf-platform -o yaml > k8s/ca-key-pair-secret.yaml
```
-->

## 1.7. Private container registry setup

For the CTFd container image you need to use a private registry. For local development speed. The objective is to get a secret stored in your Kubernetes cluster.

Create another personal access token in GitLab. This time select the following scopes. **read_registry** and **write_registry**.

You need to create a persistent Kubernetes secret. This will be used to authenticate to the private container registry and pull an image.

Adapt the following command to utilize your own login credentials and create a Kubernetes secret that will output to YAML format.

```bash
kubectl create --save-config=true secret docker-registry gitlab-pull --docker-server=registry.gitlab.com \
--docker-username={GitLab username or email address} \
--docker-password={personal access token} \
--docker-email={email address} \
-n ctf-platform --dry-run='client' -o yaml > k8s/1-gitlab-pull-secret.yaml
```

The command has generated a Yaml manifest for you. Save this and don't share it, since it's only Base64 encoded.

## 1.8. CTFd Kubernetes deployment

Use te following command to deploy all CTFd components described in the manifest.

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

The output should be.

```Bash
secret/gitlab-pull created
service/ctfd-service created
deployment.apps/ctfd created
issuer.cert-manager.io/ca-issuer created
certificate.cert-manager.io/kubernetes-docker-internal created
ingress.networking.k8s.io/ctfd-ingress created
secret/ca-key-pair created
```

See in what state the pod is. With the status `ImagePullBackOff` your provided GitLab credentials in the previously created `gitlab-pull`  secret are insufficient. A second possibility is that the GitLab access permissions on the repository for your account are insufficient.

```Bash
kubectl get pods -n ctf-platform
```

The output should be as follows.

```Bash
NAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ctfd-78f786956f-wvbkt   1/1     Running   0          7m9s
```

**Tip:** you can continuously watch the resource by adding the `--watch` paramater. 

Seeing results of the application (CTFd) component.

```bash
kubectl logs service/ctfd-service -n ctf-platform
```

Expected output.

```Bash

```

The service is now ready at [kubernetes.docker.internal](http://kubernetes.docker.internal). Provided you have no other services running on port 443. Expect a warning about an invalid certificate. Depending on your browser, you may need to go into incognito mode to proceed. 

You can now finish the setup. The required fields are: **Event Name** > **Admin Username**, **Admin Email** and **Admin Password**.

When you logout of the admin account, you're able to login with other accounts. Ones that you manually created as admin or affiliated / supported educational institutions by the SURFconext federated identity. 

### 1.8.1. Verification of deployed resources (optional)

Information about the application's deployment can be displayed with.

```Bash
kubectl describe deployment ctfd -n ctf-platform
```

Service information can be displayed with.

```Bash
kubectl describe service -n ctf-platform
```

Check the created Kubernetes secrets.

```Bash
kubectl get secret kubernetes-docker-internal-tls gitlab-pull -n ctf-platform
kubectl describe secret kubernetes-docker-internal-tls gitlab-pull -n ctf-platform
```

Check that the ingress resource `HOSTS` is mapped to [kubernetes.docker.internal](http://kubernetes.docker.internal), with `ADDRESS` mapped to [localhost](http://localhost).

```Bash
kubectl get ingress -n ctf-platform
kubectl describe ingress -n ctf-platform
```

Or see all the results at once.

```Bash
kubectl get namespace,deployments,service,ingress,secret -n ctf-platform
kubectl describe deployments,service,ingress,secret -n ctf-platform
```

## 1.9. Backup & restore

When you have the CTFd platform running and added some challenges or other things. Your're able to backup your CTF event to a zip file and restore it later if necessary.

You can restore a backup by importing the zip file included in this repository, it will load some basic challenges for you. To import the backup, go to **Admin Panel**, then click **Config** in the top menu. You will see **Backup** in the sidebar and click on **Import**. Choose the zip included or one of yourself and click on **Import**. When uploading seems to get stuck, reload the site by browsing to the homepage. You can login with the credentials stored in the backup of the CTF event.

**Admin credentials:**
Username: _admin_
Password: _jcr_

## 1.10. Clean-up

The following command will delete all custom created resources.

```Bash
kubectl delete -f k8s/
```

The namespace you've created, will have to be manually deleted.

```Bash
kubectl delete namespace ctf-platform
```

Uninstall cert-manager.

```Bash
kubectl delete -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.5.3/cert-manager.yaml
```

Uninstall the NGINX ingress controller.

```Bash
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.0.0/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
```

If you really want to be sure all resources are deleted or when you run into trouble, then the cluster can always be resetted. Instructions at [1.3.1. Resetting Docker Desktop and Kubernetes](README.md#131-resetting-docker-desktop-and-kubernetes).

## 1.11. Known Issues

## 1.12. CTFd not accessible due to port conflict

When deploying the CTFd platform locally there is a possibility that there is a conflict with other running applications on the host system. The CTFd platform listens on the port 443. When on Windows you can use the `Get-NetTCPConnection` command to see if there are other processes that run on port 443.

Open Powershell and run this command:
```Powershell
try {Get-NetTCPConnection -ea stop -LocalPort 443 | select local*,state,@{Name="Process";Expression={(Get-Process -Id $_.OwningProcess).ProcessName}}} catch {write-output "Port 443 not in use"}
```
You now see a list of processes that run on the 443 port or a message showing that port 443 is not in use.
If there is more than 1 process that runs on the 443 port there is a possibility that the other processes are hijacking the http request to the CTFd website. 

To resolve this issue you can close the other processes.

VMware workstation is one application that can conflict with the CTFd platform. It has a deprecated feature for sharing VMs that defaults to port 443. To resolve this you can turn the feature off.

## 1.13. CTFd logs in Docker Desktop

CTFd logs can be viewed with the provided command.

```Bash
kubectl logs service/ctfd-service -n ctf-platform
```

Docker desktop also provides logs for each container, though the messages may arrive in a different order.
